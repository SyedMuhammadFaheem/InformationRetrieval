recmoto various misc the of loki jorgenson dod 1210 updated stats rides ed green dod 111 and others do i get a dod number if the most frequently asked question in recmotorcycles is what is the dod then the second most frequently asked question must be how do i get a dod number that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keepers for a number if youre feeling creative and your favorite number hasnt been taken already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning nonnumeric non base10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you wont get it but you will pay for it oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in email youll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and youll look like a clueless newbie too by now youre probably asking so whos the kotl already well as john sloan notes below thats about the only real secret left around here but a few unsubtle hints can be divulged first it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe though john was the original kotl second in keeping with the true spirit of unix the kotls first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters 25 the kotl shares his name with a line oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers fourth there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a deadhead newsflash a message from the kotl once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or two during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotls employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader if you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the kotl memorizes the list one more thing the kotl says that its telepathic powers arent what they used to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name statecountry email address for example 0111ed greencaedgreeneastsuncom ps while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership thats not strictly true these days as there are a number of denizens who lack one or both blaine dances with bikers gardner blgardnejavelinsimescom denizens of doom by bruce tanner dod 0161 road rider august 1991 reprinted with bruces permission there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do they discuss motorcycles and motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops helmets antifog shields spine protectors aerodynamics threeangle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship they argue with each other and plan rides together the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to face the members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer the computers range from laptops to multimillion dollar computer centers the people range from college and university students to hightech industry professionals to publicaccess electronic bulletinboard users currently recmotorcycles pronounced wreckdotmotorcycles its the file name for the groups primary online meeting place carries about 2250 articles per month it is read by an estimated 29000 people most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the denizens of doom usually referred to as the dod the dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name denizen of doom a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr 0003 keeper of the flame bruce was then designated dod nr 0002 retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr 0001 the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so john sloan dod nr 0011 became keeper of the list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one to date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the united states and canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france germany norway and finland keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch the initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately the profits from this went to the american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser selling denizens of doom pins to members was started by arnie skurow a few months later again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation so far the denizens have contributed over 1500 to the ama museum a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage museum as often as possible the doders crawl out from behind their crts and go riding together it turns out that the two largest concentrations of doders are centered near denverboulder colorado and in californias silicon valley consequently two major events are the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california joust the rideandfeed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big barbecue dinner the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern california ride south riders from southern california to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july though its a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective communications hub recmotorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of twowheeled camaraderie its a great way for kindred spirits to get together long may they flame live to flame flame to this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insults are known as flames issuing them is called flaming flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network a typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like what an incredibly stupid statement you spandexclad poseur this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your cat the denizens of doom the saga unfolds by john sloan dod 0011 periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that youre such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership 1 wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of recmotorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod 2 to post it for him dod 2 not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so flaming and other amusements followed he who would become the holder of dod membership 3 thought this was the funniest thing hed seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number perhaps readers of recmotorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts it could also be that were all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membershipmailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod 9 club patches organized by 11 and even an mtvstyle music video produced by 47 and distributed on vhs by 18 where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the onboard engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386sized unix system only time will tell the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name live to flame flame to live the dod daemon as seen on the patches pins etc by rogers car377druhiattcom dod 0003 dod x x x x x x l f i l v a e m e t o t o f l l a vvvvv i m v e e x x x x x recmotorcycles x usenet

heels and bright pink shorts full leathers and a bra i wish i rode a harley just like my dear mama chorus refrain why you have to be killed well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the dod started as a joke and in the words of one denizen it intends to remain one sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked what does dod stand for its not the department of defense is it naturally a denizen who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied thats classified we could tell you but then wed have to kill you and the rest is history a variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for notable contributions and contributers where known include daughters of democracy dod of donuts dancers of despair dod of daughters dickweeds of of death debauchers of of dirtbikes note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of ones imagination or dictionary file the recmotophoto archive first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a recmotorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp email access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles a few nonphoto files are available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow pages the general recmotorcycles faq and this faq posting here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive via ftp cerritosedu 13015020021 via email the address is servercerritosedu the commands are given in the body of the message the current commands are dir and send given one per line the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications for recmotophoto the file spec is dodfile for example you can send dir dod send dodbrucetannergif send doddodframeps and youll get back 5 mail messages a directory listing 3 uuencoded parts of brucetannergif and the dodframeps file in ascii oh wildcards are allowed but a maximum of 20 mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send a send dodgif would send 150 files of 50k each not a good idea bruce tanner 213 8602451 x 596 tannercerritosedu cerritos college norwalk ca cerritostanner a couple of comments bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the recmotophoto archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time patches what patches you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches pins and your reaction was probably i want or thats sick or perhaps thats sick i want well theres some good news and some bad news the good news is that theres been an amazing variety of dodlabeled widgets created the bad news is that there isnt anywhere you can buy any of them this isnt because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says im thinking of having a dod frammitz made theyll cost xxxx with xxxx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the prepaid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action heres a
